Linux

Download ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz and:

$ tar -xzf ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
$ cd ta-lib/
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ sudo make install

    If you build TA-Lib using make -jX it will fail but that's OK! Simply rerun make -jX followed by [sudo] make install.

Note: if your directory path includes spaces, the installation will probably fail with No such file or directory errors.

    This is a 32-bit binary release. If you want to use 64-bit Python, you will need to build a 64-bit version of the library. Some unofficial instructions for building on 64-bit Windows 10 or Windows 11, here for reference:

        Download and Unzip ta-lib-0.4.0-msvc.zip
        Move the Unzipped Folder ta-lib to C:\
        Download and Install Visual Studio Community (2015 or later)
            Remember to Select [Visual C++] Feature
        Build TA-Lib Library
            From Windows Start Menu, Start [VS2015 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt]
            Move to C:\ta-lib\c\make\cdr\win32\msvc
            Build the Library nmake
